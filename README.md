## 💻 how to run
 
*(Tested on macOS/Linux with Python 3.8+)*

### step 1: clone & navigate
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RohanShukla23/cifar10-classifier.git
cd cifar10-classifier
```

### step 2: set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

### Step 3: install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: download dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset will auto-download when you first run the project. Just make sure you have ~170MB of free space.

### Step 5: train the model
```bash
python train.py
```
brew some coffee like I did ☕ — training takes ~15 minutes on a decent CPU (or ~5 mins with an NVIDIA GPU).
